React Feature Flipper HOC.

> Feature Toggles (often also refered to as Feature Flags) are a powerful technique, allowing teams to modify system behavior without changing code.

> -- <cite>Martin Fowler</cite>

If you don't know about **feature flippers** (**feature toggles/flags**) please read [here](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) from Martin Fowler and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle) from wikipedia.

TL:DR; this technique allows you to activate/de-active your feature without changing code while your application is running. And this can be done on certain criteria and time. It can be applied to certain individuals (users) or you can use it for A/B testing.

This library offers you a React HOC (high order component) to add your project. 

Installation
============

This module is distributed via npm which is bundled with node and should be installed as one of your project's dependencies:

```bash
yarn add react-feature-flipper
```

Usage
=====

There are 2 HOCs:

##### featureFlipper (or alternatively featureFlipperStatic with named import)

This component is the default export of a library.

* Import `featureFlipper` into your React project with default import.

```js
import featureFlipper from 'react-feature-flipper';
```

Code below enables `<HelloWorld />` component wherever used. Second item in array param enables/disables your component. 

```js
export default featureFlipper([HelloWorld, true])

```


#### featureFlipperPromise

* Import `featureFlipperPromise` into your React project.

```js
import { featureFlipperPromise } from 'react-feature-flipper';
```

And use it as shown below.

* Pass required parameters to featureFlipperPromise method call with an array items:
  * First (required): Your Component
  * Second (required): Promise to return all feature flippers. It should be an object with a property `features` having feature flippers (array of string).
  * Third (optional): The name of the feature flipper (string) you want to bind to a Component. If you omit this param then HOC uses the name of the component to find required feature flipper. eg. It would be `HelloWorld` for the example below.

```js
export default featureFlipper([
  HelloWorld,
  new Promise(resolve => 
    resolve({
      features: ['hello_world', 'blabla']
    })),
  'hello_world'
])
```
